'''Module that creates a logistic regression object in order to analyze sentences.
Parameters can be set manually in order to have useful results even withour a learning database.
The Objective_Analyzer can be extend with deterministic functions such as the extract_numbers_and_symbols for a deterministic part of the analyze.
